        <div class="text">Unit-01's armor is primarily purple; 
            some components are colored neon green, periwinkle blue, orange, and black. 
            The helmet, with its prominent horn and "frill", is vaguely evocative of an one horn Oni.

        <div class="text">The pectoral plates are different from those seen on any other Evangelion. 
            The humanoid entity beneath the armor has light brown skin, two emerald-green eyes, 
            four small nostrils positioned pre-orbitally, and red blood.

        <div class="text">Unit-01 is piloted by Shinji Ikari (with Rei Ayanami or a Rei dummy plug as backup pilots) 
            and has the best battle record of all the Evangelions.

        <div class="text">The Evangelion's resident soul, Yui Ikari (Shinji's mother), appears to be responsible for such events. 
            Unit-01 is called the "Test Type", perhaps because of the experimental way in which it was created: 
            although Unit-01 seems to be an Adam-derived cybernetic organism like all other Evangelions, 
            it is the sole Evangelion to have been born from Lilith.

        <div class="text">As a result of Third Impact, at the conclusion of The End of Evangelion, 
            Unit-01 is left floating adrift in space, fossilized and still containing the soul of Yui Ikari, 
            where it will outlast the sun and moon, as an eternal testament that the human race existed.
